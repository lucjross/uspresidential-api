<p><span class="text-uppercase">The Presidential Ranker</span> is a presidential ranking application designed to tailor a ranking of the United States' chief executives for each user based on their responses to presidential events and decisions. In the process, users will not only learn about the presidents and American history but gain insight into their own political beliefs as well. Users will be able to compare their rankings of the presidents with rankings by other users through <a href="about:blank">statistical visualizations</a> of global rankings and rankings filtered by user demographics.</p>

<p>The Presidential Ranker was created by Jonathan Hobratsch and Lucas Ross.</p>

<p>The Presidential Ranker is a free public service, but we gratefully accept donations toward costs of hosting the app. We invite <a href="about:blank">comments and criticism</a> from our users so that we can make The Presidential Ranker a go-to for both professional and amateur scholars and enthusiasts of American politics and history.</p>
